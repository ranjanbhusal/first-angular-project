ng serve  --> will run the web server //normally on localhost port no 4200

npm install --save bootstrap@3 --> install bootstrap into the project locally

go to node_modules folder and find bootstrap dependency injection and give the address of its in angular.json file in the style parameter.

ng generate component servers // n g c servers // create a new component 

about the template of the component: template can be used to write html code inside ts wherese templateURL can be used to give external link 
of html file.

property binding and string interpolation // both of them have the same functionality..
<p>{{addNewServer}}</p> 
<p [innerText] = 'addNewServer'></p> 

input also have a event called input
<input type = 'text' class = 'form-control' (input) = 'inputOnScreen($event)'>
event can carry all the data related with this input event
this is like the alternative way to use the double binding but the event parameter in the ts function should use:
event.target.value   ==>> (<HTMLInputElement>event.target).value;

<app-server *ngFor = "let server of servers; let i = index"></app-server>  //servers is binded from component class and index is the reserved word for each iteration.
